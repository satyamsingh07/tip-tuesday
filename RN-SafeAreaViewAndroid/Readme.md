#### How to implement SafeAreaView for Android

- The purpose of SafeAreaView is to render content within the safe area boundaries of a device.
- It is currently only applicable to iOS devices with iOS version 11 or later.
- How do we ensure a similar setup for Android devices?
- Well for one we could add a bit of styling in our SafeAreaView component

- Now, add this simple piece of code inside the container:

```
paddingTop: Platform.OS === 'android' ? StatusBar.currentHeight : 0
```

- This code checks the operating system of the device and if itâ€™s Android, it adjusts the top padding according to the dimensions Of the device
- In the final code, make sure to import Platform and StatusBar.
